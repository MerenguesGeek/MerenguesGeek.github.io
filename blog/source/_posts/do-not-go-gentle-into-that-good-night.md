For last few days, there's some huge life changes happened to me. Fortunately, it's happened. 

After experiencing these changes, I firmly believe that I will live the life I really want without someone. It is realy hard to love someone, but more difficult to hit it off. 

Do not go gentle into that good night, and dot not go gentle into someone's life.
